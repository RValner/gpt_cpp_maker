# gpt_cpp_maker
Creates and automatically compiles C++ programs from natural language input using GPT

## Setup

* Install openai python package: `pip install openai`.
* [Generate a key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) for using openai API.
* Store this key in a separate file.

## Usage

``` bash
# Export the key as an environment variable
export GPT_API_KEY=$(cat <path/to/openai_key>)

# Invoke the script
python scripts/gpt_cpp_maker.py -sp <PATH/FOR/GENERATED/SOURCE/CODE> -f objects.cpp -p "Create a C++ program that creates two squares and three triangles that have unique names. Store them in a vector and print out their names. All shapes inherit a common base class. Use shared pointers instead of raw pointers."
```

## Example analysis

In this example the input was:
> *"Create a C++ program that creates two squares and three triangles that have unique names. Store them in a vector and print out their names. All shapes inherit a common base class. Use shared pointers instead of raw pointers."*

And this is the C++ code that was generated by GPT along with a GCC command to compile the program via terminal

GCC command:

``` bash
g++ -o objects objects.cpp
```

C++ source code:

``` c++
/*
 * The following code has been completely generated by GPT from prompt:
 *   "Create a C++ program that creates two squares and three triangles that have
 *    unique names. Store them in a vector and print out their names. All shapes
 *    inherit a common base class. Use shared pointers instead of raw pointers."
